    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "On the path to designing the purest singleton we could, we reviewed how Python handles instantiation in its world of \"everything is object\". We saw how inheritance could perturb instantiation and how metaclasses helped taking back control.\n",
    "\n",
    "We challenged our solution in multithreaded environments and learnt how to cope with _race conditions_ and _deadlocks_. It pushed us to dive a little further into metaclasses. After every attempt, our Singleton got more robust, our understanding of Instantiation got sharper."
